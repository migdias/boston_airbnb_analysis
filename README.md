## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

The Jupyter Notebooks present in this repository were made using Python 3 (any Python 3.* will work)

Furthermore, for **Data Processings**, the following packages were used:

- Pandas and Geopandas
- Numpy
- AST

For **Visualizing**:

- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Geoplot

For **Modelling**:

- Sklearn

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The idea of starting to host on Airbnb has come to many peoples mind but some people lack the information they need to make a great transition into this airbnb hosting world and, by the time of their first reviews, it might be too late to make your listiing the best it can be. Therefore I used the 2017 Boston Airbnb Dataset in order to understand the key principles about being a host and how to get the most out of it. For that I asked the following questions:

1. **Which neighbourhoods are best for hosting?**
2. **How does the price fluctuate throughout the year?**
3. **What is mostly correlated with being a Superhost?**
4. **What features influence the price the most?**

## File Descriptions<a name="descriptions"></a>

There are two different Jupyter Notebooks in this repository. They are both explicitly named for people to understand what they do. 

- **Airbnb - Data Processing and Imputation**: Preprocessing of the boston airbnb data for 2017 is computed. Anything ranging from data gathering and assessing to cleaning and imputing missing values. 

- **Airbnb - Data Analysis**: Analysis of the previous preprocessed data is done and many visualizations are computed to help answer the questions in the motivation. This notebook contains some light processing, modelling, visualising and detailed explanations and conclusions about the data,

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main conclusions and results can be found in the notebook *Airbnb - Data Analysis*. But if you wish for a cleaner and better written results you can check my blog post on Medium HEREEEEEEE.

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgments<a name="licensing"></a>

Shoutout to Airbnb for providing a great dataset for analysis. The licensing for this dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston). Thank you for your interest in my analysis and feel free to use my code for anything you'd like. 

Cheers.
